## âœ¨ Stukk â€” Modern Tkinter UI (Fork of CustomTkinter)

**Stukk** is a fork of [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter), a modern UI library for Pythonâ€™s Tkinter. This project continues to offer fully customizable, modern widgets with light/dark theme support and HighDPI scaling.

> Stukk introduces improvements, bug fixes, and a modernized configuration with focus on maintainability and ongoing development.

---

## ðŸ†• Changes introduced in Stukk

For details on changes and improvements introduced in this fork, please refer to the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md).

---

## ðŸš€ Installation

```bash
pip install stukk
```

> The package installs as `stukk`, but you still import it as:

```python
import customtkinter
```

> To set up the development environment, follow the instructions in [project-setup.md](./docs/project-setup.md).

---

## ðŸ”­ Future plans

- Additional bug fixes inherited from the original project.
- Introduction of new features and enhancements.

---

## ðŸ“š Documentation

You can refer to the [official CustomTkinter documentation](https://customtkinter.tomschimansky.com/documentation), since **Stukk** is currently API-compatible.

---

## ðŸ§ª Basic Example

```python
import customtkinter

customtkinter.set_appearance_mode("System")  # system (default), light, dark
customtkinter.set_default_color_theme("blue")  # blue (default), dark-blue, green

app = customtkinter.CTk()
app.geometry("400x240")

def button_function():
    print("button pressed")

button = customtkinter.CTkButton(master=app, text="CTkButton", command=button_function)
button.place(relx=0.5, rely=0.5, anchor=customtkinter.CENTER)

app.mainloop()
```

## ðŸ“¸ Screenshots and Examples

> The following images and videos are from the original project and still apply to Stukk.

### Appearance mode change and scaling change

CustomTkinter can adapt to the Windows 10/11 light or dark mode:

| _`complex_example.py` on Windows 11 with system appearance mode change and standard 'blue' theme_

###

On macOS you either need python3.10 or higher or the anaconda python
version to get a dark window header (Tcl/Tk >= 8.6.9 required):

| _`complex_example.py` on macOS with system appearance mode change, user-scaling change and standard 'blue' theme_

###

### Button with images

It's possible to put an image on a CTkButton. You just have to
pass a PhotoImage object to the CTkButton with the `image` argument.
If you want no text at all you have to set `text=""` or you specify
how to position the text and image at once with the `compound` option:

| _`image_example.py` on Windows 11_

###

### Scrollable Frames

Scrollable frames are possible in vertical or horizontal orientation and can be combined
with any other widgets.

| _`scrollable_frame_example.py` on Windows 11_

### Integration of TkinterMapView widget

In the following example I used a TkinterMapView which integrates
well with a CustomTkinter program. It's a tile based map widget which displays
OpenStreetMap or other tile based maps:

| _`examples/map_with_customtkinter.py` from TkinterMapView repository on Windows 11_
